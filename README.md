# D-Card — Digital University ID (Prototype)

D-Card is an NFC-enabled, wallet-ready digital university identity system designed to replace physical student and staff ID cards.

This project was developed as part of the **New Product Development** module during the **MSc Technology Management at UCL**.

The prototype demonstrates how a secure, mobile-first credential can support campus access, identity verification, and role-based permissions for students, staff, guests, and administrators.
