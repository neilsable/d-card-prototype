## ✨ What is D-Card?

**D-Card** is an NFC-inspired, wallet-ready **digital university identity system** designed to replace physical student and staff ID cards.

Built as part of the **New Product Development** module in the  
**MSc Technology Management (UCL)**, the project explores how a **secure, mobile-first credential** can modernise campus access, identity verification, and role-based permissions.

This is not just a UI mock — it is a **functional prototype** demonstrating real product thinking.

---

## 🎯 Why D-Card?

Physical ID cards are:
- Easy to lose
- Hard to revoke instantly
- Costly to reissue
- Poorly integrated with modern mobile behaviour

D-Card reframes identity as:
> **A dynamic, role-aware digital credential — always in your phone.**

---

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

- 📱 **Digital identity registration & verification**
- 🧩 **Role-based access logic**  
  (student · staff · guest · admin)
- 📡 **NFC-style “tap” simulation** for campus terminals
- 👛 **Apple Wallet & Google Wallet visual previews**
- 🛂 **Admin approval & audit logging**
- 🧾 **Guest / day-pass access**
- ☁️ **Cloud-hosted prototype (Vercel)**

Each flow is designed to reflect **real institutional constraints**, not just ideal UX.

## 🖥️ Live Demo

🔗 **Live Prototype**  
https://d-card-prototype.vercel.app

🔗 **Source Repository**  
https://github.com/neilsable/d-card-prototype

## 🧱 Technology Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Vercel** (deployment)
- Client-side token & access simulation  
  *(prototype scope)*

---

## 🔐 Security & Scope

This is a **conceptual and functional prototype**.

- No real NFC hardware integration  
- No personal data storage  
- No live university systems  

Security, access control, and auditing are demonstrated at a **design and logic level**, suitable for product validation and stakeholder discussion.
