# Security & Trust Model

## Identity Verification
- Users submit personal details and a photo
- Admin manually verifies compliance (prototype scope)

## Access Control
- Role-based rules engine
- Explicit allow / deny decisions
- Location-aware validation

## Audit Logging
- Each terminal tap is logged
- Includes timestamp, location, decision, and reason

## Prototype Limitations
- No biometric storage
- No real NFC encryption
- No university SSO integration

The prototype demonstrates **security architecture patterns**, not production enforcement.
